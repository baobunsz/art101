             <h1>Hello World</h1>

             <p>"I'm Bao Hy Dang. I'm a junior at UC Santa Cruz, majoring Arts & Design: Games and Playable Media (AGPM). 
                I love drawing and playing video games in my free time. 
                My favorite animal is Axolotl and my favorite food is Vietnamese Broken Rice. 
                Fellow Travelers, Firebird are the two movies that I love.
                My partner for this class, Elisa, is also an AGPM major. 
                She is amazing when it comes to art and animation.
                She also has some cool makeup and accessories! For some reason, I mixed up her name with "Celeste" a lot...
                Sorry Elisa :3"
