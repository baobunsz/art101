			<h1>Lab 3 - File structure </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Organizing a local file structure, adding index.html to my files, and uploading them to the server with my partner.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I got quite lost with multiple lines of code at first. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>After a while playing around with VSCode, I got used to how our artg101 folder looks
						since it's somewhat similar to the files on my computer. 
						Beyond that, I put efforts in this assignment through utilizing the knowledge from previous class lectures 
						while asking my partner questions since she figured the lab out before I did!
					</p>
